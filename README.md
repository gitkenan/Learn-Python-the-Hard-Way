# Learn Python the Hard Way

This is the documentation of my following of Zed Shaw's book 'Learn Python the Hard Way'. 

## How To Follow

If you'd like to run any of these files, you can do the following.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 2.7.3 installed (or a similar version of Python 2). Then, save one of the .py files in a given 
local directory. Suppose you have saved it in /Users/Jeff/mystuff/LPtHW. Then, in Windows Powershell, you can run 
this file by typing:

```
cd Users/Jeff/mystuff/LPtHW
```

Where 'cd' means to change directory. Once you have entered the right folder, you can then run the given file
by typing 

```
python ex1.py
```

and pressing enter to execute the file.
